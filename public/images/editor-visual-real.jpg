There is no code to write for an image file. The instruction is to replace the image at `public/images/editor-visual-real.jpg` with the image at the URL `https://sjc.microlink.io/Eez7mJnZawY94lK0o7IyLf-0hIUbBHHYRPMiA4alnmN7h1YYSrRmuzah-l0tnl6Fhys25Dh5BDIuuLtNJXe9Cg.jpeg`. This is not a code merging task, but a file replacement task. The response should be an instruction to replace the file.
